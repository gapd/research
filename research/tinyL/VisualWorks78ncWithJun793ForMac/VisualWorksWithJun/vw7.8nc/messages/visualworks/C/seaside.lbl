Tuning this priority (relative to worker process and listener process priorities) allows to put emphasis on different aspects of the request processing. If it is more important to accept new connections than serve the existing ones, then the listener priority should be higher. If you want requests being processed faster than new ones being received, then worker priority needs to go up, etc. Note however that it is very easy to starve other activities if you give too much priority to something that takes a lot of effort. You need to tune the priorities to the particular needs of your specific application, the load patterns that you expect, the amount of effort it takes to complete each request, etc. It may take several attempts to get it right.When this setting is changed, the new value applies only to new connections established after that point.'ServerType = 'Server Type'ServerTypeHelpText = 'This setting specifies the type of seaside server to run.	HTTP - The server will use the regular buffered response and persistent connections (allowing multiple request/response exchanges over the same connection)		Streaming HTTP - The server will use WAStreamedResponse which is required for some types of components, for example Comet. In this mode the response will be written directly to the socket stream and connections will be closed after each response.	CGI - The server will employ CGITransport expecting to run behind an external web server, e.g. Apache or IIS.
