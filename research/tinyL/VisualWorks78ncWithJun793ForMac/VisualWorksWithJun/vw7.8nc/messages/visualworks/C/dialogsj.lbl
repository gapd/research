These settings are used by finding the font for displaying the text with the default font.  The families are put in order of the priorities.  The priorities can be changed by drag&drop the family entry.  The family can include $* or $# as wild-card character.The settings may not effect if the Locale has own preferred font family setting which is prefixed to this list, or the effect may be canceled by some other attributes of the font description e.g. manufacturer, serifness and so on.  For the latter, think of removing ''*'' as well as undesired families.'
