All Rights Reserved.Comment: Load all of PDPVersion 3.1 for VW 7.1.This parcel loads the whole of Professional Debug Package (PDP).PDP enhances the VW IDE with the following features;- Breakpoints and watchpoints that don't affect the source code.- A much improved debugger.- A new process monitor.If you publish PDP to your Store repostitory, the package PDPCompmust be published as binary.Also, PDP is incompatible with the standard debugger.  Do not install itinto an image if you need the standard debugger to work properly.More information can be found in the pdp\Readme.1st file and thePDP user manual, found in the Docs directory.DbIdentifier: bear73DbTrace: 293725DevelopmentPrerequisites: #(#(#any 'Debugger-Process Monitor' '') #(#any 'Debugger-Browser Extensions' ''))PackageName: Debugger-Load AllParcel: #('Debugger-Load All')ParcelName: Debugger-Load AllPrerequisiteParcels: #(#('Debugger-Process Monitor' '') #('Debugger-Browser Extensions' ''))PrintStringCache: (7.8 - 1000,tgriggs)Version: 7.8 - 1000Post-Load Block: 	[:package || fn |fn := (LogicalFilename named: '$(VISUALWORKS)\pdp\Testlib.st') asFilename.fn exists	ifTrue: [CraftedSmalltalk.ProbeTestExpressionEditor readLibraryFromFile: fn].fn := (LogicalFilename named: '$(VISUALWORKS)\pdp\Watchlib.st') asFilename.fn exists	ifTrue: [CraftedSmalltalk.ProbeActionExpressionEditor readLibraryFromFile: fn].]Date: 9:15:31 AM March 11, 2011 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorks®, 7.8 of March 4, 2011 on March 11, 2011 at 9:15:31 AM</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.
