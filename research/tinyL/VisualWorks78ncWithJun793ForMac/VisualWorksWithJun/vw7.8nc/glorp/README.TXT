README for GLORP

These directories contain code for GLORP: Generic Lightweight
Object-Relational Persistence. GLORP is an open source Smalltalk
library for storing and retrieving objects from relational databases. See the 
file COPYING.TXT for license conditions. Glorp is officially supported code 
as of VisualWorks 7.6, but documentation is limited.
 
For more information, see http://www.glorp.org. There is also a mailing list,
run from http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/glorp

The latest versions of GLORP can also be found in the public store 
repository. See http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com

Included in this directory are

 Glorp.pcl/.pst - The main body of the Glorp code
 GlorpTest.pcl/.pst - Tests for Glorp. This is also a useful source of examples.
 GlorpVWPort.pcl/.pst - A prerequisite for Glorp, containing VisualWorks-specific code. The main 
body of Glorp code is portable between Smalltalk dialects, and this parcel contains only the code
that cannot be written in a portable way.
