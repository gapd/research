The image version is referred to as the trunk and the repository version is referred to as the branch. The merge process first finds the most recent version that is the ancestor of trunk and the branch, i.e. where branch forked off. Next, changes are computed from this common (base) version to both the trunk and the branch. For each component change, a modification set is created. Each modification set holds the changes made by the versions being merged.<nn>After all the modification sets have been created, the modifications are analyzed to calculate resolutions. If there is only one change from the base version then that change becomes the resolution. If there is more than one change then the modification set is left to the user to resolve. Additionally, if the computed resolution is already in the trunk then the modification is marked as having been applied. Also, if the "Hide Image Only Mods" option, under the View menu, is set then these mods are not shown in the modification view.<nn>Image Only Mods are modification sets that contain only changes between the base version and the image. When one considers the image version to be the trunk version the image only mods are of little interest because they are the desired changes and need no further review.<nn>The modification sets are displayed in either in a list or a hierarchy in the Modifications pane. The resolution status of each modification set is shown by the leftmost icon. Upon selecting a modification set, the individual modification versions are shown in the Versions pane. The user can then review, compare, and determine which version is to be the resolution. After the modification resolutions have been determined they must be applied. Applying a resolution modifies the image to correspond to the resolution. After all resolutions have been applied the bundles/packages can be published.<nn>Selecting packages to merge<nt>Open the package selection dialog either from the Packages menu or from "Select Packages..." button.<nt>Only bundles/packages loaded in the image will appear in the "Bundles and packages" list. Upon selecting a package/bundle the versions will appear in the "Versions:" list. The versions to merge can then be added to the "Selected versions:" list.<nt>When the "Selected versions:" list has all the desired versions, hit the OK button and the process to calculate the modification set will begin.<nn>Modifications Pane<n>The modification sets can be viewed (top left) either in a list or a hierrarchy. When viewed in a hierarchy the first level is either a package or a bundle. The second level items can be a namespace, a class, a property, or an aggregate class operation.<nn>Commands<nt>Unresolve<tttt>Marks the modification set as being unresolved.
