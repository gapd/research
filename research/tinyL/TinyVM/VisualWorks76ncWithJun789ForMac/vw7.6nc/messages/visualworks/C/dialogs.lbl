The setting on this page controls which of these formats is used by programming tools, if they do not have a way to control this feature themselves. Not all of these formats may appear on this page, if they have not yet been implemented.Smalltalk chunk format saves Smalltalk programs in a form similar to that used in previous versions of VisualWorks, with Smalltalk expressions separated by exclamation marks. It is not completely compatible with previous VisualWorks releases, since it has been extended substantially for Name Spaces.XML format saves Smalltalk programs using an XML markup set designed to capture as much as possible of the VisualWorks system changes. It is a new technology, but offers the possibility of capturing much more detailed meta-information about the program than Smalltalk chunk format, and hence allowing much more powerful tools for manipulating source files.ANSI interchange format is a file-out format designed for interchange between all dialects of Smalltalk. It is currently a varient of Smalltalk chunk format, but much more verbose and less readable. It allows programs to be migrated from one Smalltalk to another, but when the code is loaded into the new Smalltalk, some additional information may be lost, resulting in a non-functional program.'fileOutOn = 'File out on'fileSize = 'Size:     'FilesOfTypeC = 'Files of type:'fileToEdit = 'Please type a file name: 'fileWasModified = 'File has been independently modified, overwrite?'FilingInFromColon = 'Filing in from:'FilingInN1S = 'Filing in<n><1s>'FilingInSelectedText = 'Filing In Selected Text'FilingIntoN1S = 'Filing into<n><1s>'FilingOutChangesOnColon = 'Filing out changes on:'Filters = 'Filters'Find = 'Find...'FindAllImplementorsOfDot = 'Find all implementors of...'FindAllSendersOfDot = 'Find all senders of...'findChangeSetReferringToClass = 'Find change set referring to class:'findChangeSetReferringToSelector = 'Find change set referring to selector:'FindClass = 'Find Class'FindClassColon = 'Find class:'findImplementorsOfWhat = 'Find implementors of what?'FindNamespace = 'Find Namespace'findReferencesToWhat = 'Find references to what?'FindSelectorC = 'Find selector:'FindSharedVariable = 'Find Shared Variable'FindSharedVariableRetry = 'Could not find a shared variable matching your input.

Immutable objects will raise an exception if you attempt to modify them. By default, objects like method literals are now immutable. This can break old code. For example '''' writeStream nextPutAll: ''test''will no longer work. This was likely an error in the old code too, but now it is detected. To enable a more graceful transition to the immutability code, we allow a couple of variations in the handling of immutability errors. Note that you are still better off fixing the immutability problems, as the code will run significantly faster. For more information, see the VisualWorks documentation.This dialog allows you to choose from three options when a NoModificationError is encountered. Note that if you choose an option which includes making the object mutable and later decide to fix the error at its source, you will probably not be able to reproduce the problem until the code in question has been recompiled. This is because the literal is stored in the compiled method and will remain mutable until the code is recompiled or loaded into a new image.Signal an error -- This is the default.  An exception is raised, and if it is not handled elsewhere then a Notifier will be presented. This is a special Notifier which allows you to choose a different immutability error handling option and proceed.  The options you can choose in the Notifier are exactly the same options you can choose here, but of course the notifier is only shown if this option is in effect.You can still make changes in the settings no matter what you did in the Notifier.Print a warning and make the object mutable -- An exception is raised, but if the exception is not handled then the default action is to print a short message to the Transcript listing the method in which the error occurred (a 3 line stack trace). The receiving object is made mutable and the operation raising the exception is restarted. No notification is made that this occurred, and the receiving object remains mutable. Note that this is not equivalent to #whileMutableDo:, which restores the immutability of the object once the action completes.Silently make the object mutable -- No exception is raised. The receiving object is made mutable and the operation proceeds. No notification is made that this occurred, and the receiving object remains mutable, as above.'one = 'one'OnlyCompressionEight = 'Only compression method of 8 is supported'Open = 'Open'OpenDialogsAtCursorHelp = 'When this option is off (default), dialog boxes open centered inside the current window, or inside the screen if there is no current window.
