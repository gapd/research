# This file should serve as a template for compiling SharedLibraries on
# the PowerMac using MPW 3.5.x. It should be compatible to the
# standard MPW Build commands, if you follow these rules:
# 1.	copy this file together with "pmacbckref.lib", "oeAPI.h", and the script 
#		"trimExport.script" into your projects directory,
# 2.	edit the "LibTarget" name below, enter the name of the library
#		to be compiled/linked, 
# 3.	edit the "CSource" entry below, currently only one name is supported,
#		if you need more, you have to adapt the makefile manualy,
# 4.	save the adapted makefile under the name composed of the value you entered
#		as "LibTarget" and the string ".make",
# 5.	choose "Build ..." from the MPW Build menu and enter the name you entered
#		as the value of "LibTarget".
# 6.	watch the output in the MPW Worksheet
#
# CAUTION: If your library is suppose to make many calls into the virtual machine,
#	like this example here, then the optimization '-D OEUNSAFE' in th elist of 
#	PPCCOptions will eliminate  many security checks, and thus will give you a 
#	lot more performance.
#	BUT if you do so, you are responsible to garantee proper argument types
#	for all parameters passed to virtual machine functions.
